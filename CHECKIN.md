# Initial commit exercise

Everyone on the team should complete this exercise as soon as they have access to the team repo.

## Instructions

1. Set up the project: [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/twlevelup/watch_edition/wiki/Installation)
2. Add a test to ```teamPage.spec.js``` that checks for your name in the team page
3. Run ```./go pre-commit``` (OS X) or ```npm -s run test``` (Windows) to run the pre-commit checks - something should fail.
4. Fix the failing test by adding your name to the team page in ```team.hbs```
5. Run the pre-commit checks again - everything should pass.
6. Set your commit message to ```"[TASK][your_name] check-in dance initial commit"``` replacing ```your_name``` with, you guessed it, your name.
7. Push your changes

You may need to pull in the latest changes before you can push your own. Follow the [Continuous Integration](https://github.com/twlevelup/watch_edition#continuous-integration) steps.
